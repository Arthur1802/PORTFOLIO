                    Ever since I started taking the Information Systems course in college, I've grown more and more interested in what I could accomplish, what ideas I could make real, what real day-to-day problems I could resolve. It has become more than professional, it's my life, my hobby. I love what I do and I'm always looking for new things to learn and ways to perfect my skills.
